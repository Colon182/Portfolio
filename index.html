                    Hello, I'm Christian Colon and I'm from Camden,NJ. My hometown is known for having one of the worst
                    crime rates and for many years one of the worst murder rates as well. This afforded me no time for
                    much outdoor activity outside of organized sports. Most of my time was spent indside where I grew a
                    love for technology. This love of tech would flourish in my highschool years. I attended Saint
                    Joseph's Prep, it was there that I joined my schools game development club. I was fascinated by the
                    options and creativity needed to develop the simple games we devoloped. Everytime I was able to
                    succesfully program a character to move or react in the way we desired, it would give me a rush.
                    It's unfortunate to say that I would not revisit this passion for nearly 8 years later. It was at
                    this point that I found a passion for building and customizing computers. After about a year of
                    building and designing gaming rigs with friends and co workers, I found myself being drawn to being
                    a developer once more. This time I wanted to learn from true professionals and searched for programs
                    that maintained Coding and Programming as their focus. It was only a few weeks later that I decided
                    to join Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.
